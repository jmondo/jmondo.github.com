Ever since my appearance in Babson's production of RENT as a homeless person, I've been a closeted singer. Ok fine I also ~~sang~~ sing ~~in the car~~ on the moped. As an untrained singer in/on vehicles and showers, sometimes I wonder... how do they hit that note?
They usually don't.

I give you: [Hot Chelle Rae - Tonight, Tonight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiA_C6__bDE).

But then on a car ride to big BUF (the Buffalo/Niagara Airport) with [@polyfish42](twitter.com/polyfish42), I called another band's bluff. One Direction - [What Makes You Beautiful](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCgRNOBIRhw). No bluff here people.

These guys are crazy talented. And young. There is still hope for American British pop bands.

So talented that I actually sat down and wrote the first blog post in months about it. Wow.

As a side note, they're signed on Simon Cowell's record company (Syco) and he's a really interesting dude. I scientifically deduced that during my entrepreneurship class this semester.
