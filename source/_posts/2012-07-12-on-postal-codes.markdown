I'm importing all US postal codes into a database for a geolocation app. While the data was importing I did some scanning. Fun facts:
* Holtsville, NY is the only postal code that starts with 00. (00501)

According to Wikipedia, that's the IRS's fault. They have a tax processing center there and they have the lowest postal code. And since I (and the wiki editor) put them in the same sentence you will assume causation.

The rest of the facts aren't that fun, so I've omitted them.
