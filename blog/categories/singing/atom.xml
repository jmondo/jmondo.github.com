    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since my appearance in Babson's production of RENT as a homeless person, I've been a closeted singer. Ok fine I also <del>sang</del> sing <del>in the car</del> on the moped. As an untrained singer in/on vehicles and showers, sometimes I wonder... how do they hit that note?
They usually don't.</p>

<p>I give you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiA_C6__bDE">Hot Chelle Rae - Tonight, Tonight</a>.</p>

<p>But then on a car ride to big BUF (the Buffalo/Niagara Airport) with <a href="twitter.com/polyfish42">@polyfish42</a>, I called another band's bluff. One Direction - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCgRNOBIRhw">What Makes You Beautiful</a>. No bluff here people.</p>

<p>These guys are crazy talented. And young. There is still hope for American British pop bands.</p>

<p>So talented that I actually sat down and wrote the first blog post in months about it. Wow.</p>

<p>As a side note, they're signed on Simon Cowell's record company (Syco) and he's a really interesting dude. I scientifically deduced that during my entrepreneurship class this semester.</p>
