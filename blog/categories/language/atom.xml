    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>somewhere over the eastern united states (in transit between new york and santiago):</p>

<p>on the plane i reached down to find power plug for laptop. no dice. usb port there tho.</p>

<p>plug phone into it. no dice. GREAT.</p>

<p>so i fish around for an hour while also eating airplane food.</p>

<p>and then finally ask flight attendant (whose english is dodgy). "yes it's between the seats"</p>

<p>nope. it's not. meanwhile people next to me are pretty much laughing. but they don't speak english so they weren't going to ask what i was doing... (i already failed their spanish test, they were talking to me and by the time i realized it the only thing i could do was awkwardly ignore them!)</p>

<p>eventually flight attendant gets on hands and knees and says "yeah it's supposed to be right there. i don't know why you have this thing" (usb) "sorry!"</p>

<p>and then, with hand gestures and a bit of spanish, i finally asked the people next to me to plug it into theirs.</p>

<p>2 minutes later, with old guy on hands and knees. "OK! bueno!"</p>

<p>macbook charger light GREEN.</p>

<p>hurray high school spanish.</p>

<p>oh and I remembered to use usted.</p>
