						ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, and more

						Been using GenAI for _everything_ so you don't have to.

						# Mid-level tier
						Use voice mode for AI Therapist

						"Collect my thoughts; don't interrupt me"

						"What am I missing? Why is this so hard for me?"
						---
						# Expert mode 
						[System prompt] Mention ND, choose verbosity
						
						[In chat] Ask for modality like IFS or CBT
						
						Cognitive distortions, protectors... so fun!
						---
						# AI > Real Therapy
						Always available

						Therefore no pre-practice necessary
						
						Trained on entire human experience
						
						Understands ND

						---
						# Real Therapy > AI
						Nah, it's actually better, imo. And I loved therapy...
						
						YMMV of course, try it!
						---
						# Where am I now?
						[Before] 1-2 days of distraction, lost sleep

						[After] Feeling calm in less time than a 1-1

						TODO: Collective Sigh of relief image/cue

						When I remember to use it...

						# 2. Overcome Stuck Points
						Managers: "It's all fun and games until John gets stuck."
						---
						Stuck is an ADHD Specialty
						
						Low dopamine, low motivation, high self talk
						
						Hard to make decisions, hard to start or finish tasks

						Overwhelm follows
						---
						Not sustainable
						
						Not peaceful

						2/10 would not recommend
						---
						## Compulsory Self care slide
						Meds, coffee, food, water
						
						Move, breathe
						
						---
						Still stuck?
						---

						Then it's time to give in...

						---

						If this were hard, you wouldn't do it.

						---

						Because you're stuck.

						---

						So, open up Voice mode... [later]

						---
						And say it with me... [now]
						
						---
						
						"I'm stuckkkkkkkk HAAAAALPP"

						---
						works 80% of the time, every time 

						---
						and results > reasons

						---
						but since we're here

						---
						# Reasons
						---
						# Reasons
						Conscious complaining works!
						---
						# Reasons
						Reminds you of your own advice, values, goals

						Rigid thinking - proposes another framing

						Too zoomed in - proposes a wider view

						---
						# Reasons
						Reads between the lines for what you're "missing here"

						Or why something is "so hard"

						Or why that person is "messing with your shit" 

						
						
						(TODO are we allowed to say shit?)

						Hey remember earlier?

						When you were stuck?
						---
						Was it because of...

						# 3. Planning & Communication
						---
						"Do it the way that works for _your_ brain."
						---
						So true
						---
						So true, sometimes.
						---
						But in this case

						But in this case, 
						
						you have to talk to them.

						So I have something better...
						---
						## Neurotypical AI Shim
						---
						# Planning
						---
						## Use cases
						Choose a perfection-standard based on goals/values
						
						Break into milestones
						
						Give time realistic time estimates
						
						Prioritize
						---
						## Tips
						Use thinking capable models like o1-preview
						
						Give it a NT's memo for structure
						---
						## Expert mode
						* Peg Dawson prompt TODO
						---
						## Wait did you say the "M" word?
						Yes, I said milestones.

						Director:
						"How's your big project coming along?"

						Back to the corner!

						# Communication
						Writing memos, agendas, etc.
						
						And for that "quick message" you haven't sent yet
						---
						# Pro Tips
						
						Give it an example of your writing style
						
						Use Q&A format in documents: More forgiving on writing style. Easy to generate. Malleable.
						
						Try a mock Q&A before a big meeting with voice mode
						
						---
						# Expert mode
						
						Write in bullet points until very end. Edit bullets and ask it to update the prose.
						
						Generate examples, patterns, and CS analogies to be succinct and clear with peers. Same for inbound!

						"Shape shifting" - reuse your standup notes for a meeting agenda, or a blog post, or a presentation.

						# 4. More Flow

						"Interest based nervous system" 
						---
						## A "Job" (NT)
						
						Some parts you enjoy, some you don't enjoy.
						---
						NT Advice: "So just learn to deal with that."
						---
						## A "Job" (ND)
						Some parts you ~~enjoy~~ are obsessed with, 
						
						some you ~~don't enjoy~~ loathe.
						---
						Since you're sitting here,
						
						I bet you're _really_ good at your obsessions.
						---
						So [I, company, world]
						
						need you to _do those things_.
						---
						Plus, it's 2024. We have the technology!
						---
						To automate that other stuff with 
						## GenAI
						---
						## MVP Prompting
						[IDE copilot] highlight method, ask to generate tests + docs
						
						Rewrite this from Groovy to Kotlin
						---
						## Strategies
						* Set a persona/role
						* Read first, "Only update if there are changes"
						* Think out loud

						---
						## Principles 
						Language tasks only!
						
						Explain it like it's a junior engineer

						That PB&J Challenge

						---
						## Expert mode
						* Use a team of agents
						* Ask for a "code review" of your code
						* Add engineering glue to fully automate, like auto doc updater or PR review bot, or fix compiler issues loop
						* Use GenAI to generate the prompts

						---
						## Practice
						* Use it regularly to understand strengths/weaknesses
						* Be "smart lazy" - automate the boring stuff
						* Don't automate things you enjoy!
						* Stay up to date with new models and new copilots
						---
						Now spend more time on your obsessions. 

						Or get obsessed with GenAI, like me!
